# PostCSS Demo Plugin

[PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) plugin to demonstrate its awesomeness.

See [here](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-plugin-boilerplate) for an excellent starting point for writing your own plugins.

## Usage

This plugin isn't meant to be useful in actual projects, but to demonstrate how easy it is to develop your own PostCSS plugins.
